# 🌌 My AI & Data Science Journey  

> “Physics taught me how to ask the right questions.  
> Machine Learning is teaching me how to answer them.”  

Hi, I’m [Your Name] 👋 — a Physics graduate on a mission to transform curiosity into impact with **Data Science, AI, and Generative Models**.  
This repository is the **map of my journey** — from the very first Python loop to building AI systems that can reason, generate, and scale.
